          Welcome to the awesome world of the Pokemon Trading Card Game. This
          game works under the concept of a deck, a deck is a library or
          collection of cards that is the main unit of the game. You will
          always need a deck to play, as it is the way you interact and battle
          with other pokemon trainers. The question arises, What does a deck
          look like? And that's where the other concept enters the stage,
          formats. Formats are what shape the game and therefore, the decks.
          There are formal formats recognized by Pokemon that are used for
          tournaments, and there are also formats made by players that got
          popularized and are fun to play.

          <b>Standard.</b> <br> This is (even if it
          sounds redundant) the standard format for the game, you may be
          asking, what does that mean? It is the format that aims to
          standardize the metagame and give to both experienced and new
          players balance. This format only allows cards from the most recent
          set and its expansions (that commonly go far back a year from the
          present time) with this, new players can easily get enough cards to
          play at a more stable price. Thus, if you are new to the game, you
          don't need to have been playing for a long time in order to compete
          with other players, and if you have been playing for a long time
          then you need to evolve and keep up with the new cards (increasing
          the challenge). This game has banned cards that cannot be used on
          the game. Pokemon Inc. manages the list of banned cards.

          <b>Expanded.</b> <br> This format is meant for veterans of the game (but that
          does not mean new players cannot play it and enjoy it). Because it
          allows cards from up to 3 years ago. Getting some of those cards is
          really difficult and some others became expensive with the passing
          of time, but because of the big amount of available cards the
          possible interactions and combinations grow exponentially and become
          more complex. This format also have banned cards, the list is
          managed by Pokemon Inc.

        <p>
          <b>Unlimited.</b> <br> This format, as its name implies, has no limits, all cards
          from all expansions are allowed and there are no bans. This game is
          even more complex than the Expanded format and with that, the
          difficulty of obtaining some cards increases too. It is extremely fun
          and chaotic to the point that some games last 30 minutes only having 2
          turns played in the whole game. This format is recommended for
          experienced players, but of course, new players are welcome to play.
