            For those that are new to the game here is an explanation of how it
            works. The Pokémon Trading Card Game is a strategy-based card game
            that is usually played on a designated play-mat where two players
            (assuming the role of Pokémon trainer) use their Pokémon to battle
            each other. Each player plays one Pokémon onto the field and attacks
            their opponent's Pokémon. A Pokémon that has sustained enough damage
            from attacks-that reaches or exceeds its HP-is referred to as being
            "Knocked Out". For each of the opponent's "Knocked Out" Pokémon the
            victor scores 1 Prize Card, although some special card mechanics
            grant up to 2 or 3 Prize cards in accordance with their higher
            hierarchy. Prize cards are primary win conditions, with the
            possession of six Prize cards being an instantaneous win. Other ways
            to win are by "Knocking Out" all the Pokémon the opponent has on
            their bench (i.e. the row behind the Active, fighting Pokémon that
            houses five additional Pokémon to supplant the active Pokémon if it
            retreats or is "Knocked Out") so the opponent has no Pokémon left,
            or if at the opponent's turn there are no cards left to draw into
            their deck.
