        <h2>Learn how to build your own deck!</h2>
        <div id="guides-content-message1">
          <p>
            Wanting to create your own game experience? Tired of those pre-made
            theme decks? Here we present not a “How to build your deck” but
            rather a recommendation guide to express your style through a deck.
            There is no “right” or “wrong” deck. The beauty of this game is that
            the possibilities are infinite, and the unique interactions that can
            be achieved are only limited to your imagination.

            The first thing you must consider is the format you want your deck
            to play in. That's the major change factor in your decisions for the
            deck because (as in any other trading card game) cards are tied to
            different formats of the game, which means that some cards are
            allowed in a particular format and others are not. We have a
            separate section that explains the different formats the current
            game has and how to differentiate a card that is allowed or not on
            each. Keep in mind that and choose the format you want to build the
            deck for, that's the first decision you should make.

            <p>
              Next, here is what defines the overall structure of your deck,
              look at the cards you have, or look at the Pokemon Database for
              the different cards out there, and find the one you want to build
              your deck upon. Find the one that has the interesting ability or
              movement you want to be the base of your deck. It could be a card
              that does a lot of damage, one that poisons your opponent, or even
              one that devolves the opponent's pokemon, etc. Have fun choosing
              the card you like or the effects you think would be fun to
              explore. This will be the pillar of your new deck. Now, it gets a
              little bit more complex from here. The next task is to find a card
              that will enhance the power, movement, or ability of your main
              pokemon. For example, some pokemon allow you to poison your
              opponent's pokemon once in a turn, this could be your main
              pokemon, then, you could look for a pokemon that doubles the
              amount of damage a poisoned pokemon receives, that's a strategy
              now and it now becomes your support pokemon. The two pokemon will
              work together and leverage the power of the deck.

          <p>
            Well, the deck needs to have 60 cards. What now? Now you need to
            create a structure for your deck. Now we have to find a motor that
            will move your deck throughout the game. Some pokemon have
            interesting abilities like “Discard a card and if you do draw 2
            cards” or “When you evolve this pokemon look for a trainer in your
            deck”. That's powerful, and that will allow you to travel through
            your deck and find what you need. And what about the trainers?
            That's a good question, you cannot only rely on pokemon's
            abilities, it would be too slow, that's where trainers come in
            handy. Look for trainers that allow you to find in your deck what
            you need to power your deck. For example, if your main pokemon is
            a dark type pokemon, find trainers that help you with that kind of
            pokemon. Look for trainers that allow you to recover pokemon that
            were defeated in battle and make your library of trainers for your
            deck. Energies are a vital and tricky part. Most pokemon movements
            require energy to be performed, and that's the guide here, look at
            the pokemon you have, find the movements that you will actually
            use in battle (you probably would not need all movements your
            pokemon are capable of), and sum them up, now you have an
            approximate of the amount of energy you will need to power your
            deck.
